<h3 id="why-did-i-decide-to-use-vue-js-instead-of-angular-">Why did i decide to use Vue.js instead of Angular?</h3>
<p>For me it has always been important to make websites that both runs fast, small in size and also minimal in terms of design and code. Since vue.js both the winning part of both its size and speed i decided to go for that.</p>
<p>Having used both Angular and Vue.js i thought for this project that it would go faster to build it with Vue.js.</p>
<h3 id="what-did-i-make-">What did i make?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ui Interface built according to the design specs</li>
<li>Most of the functionality done, (will refer to the nonfunctional parts later)</li>
<li>Transfers possible that gets sent to the array list of my other transactions</li>
<li>Current status from your bank account is subtracted upon withdrawal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nonfunctional-parts">Nonfunctional parts</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have to admit that getting the filters and the search to work was the biggest problem to set up in my case, because it was hard to find resources for it, also since Iâ€™m bit new for Vue.js.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
